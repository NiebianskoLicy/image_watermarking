# <h1>Image watermarking</h1>  
This is one of end projects from [100 Days of code course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).  
Its simple image watermarketing, which you can write your text, then select img and click button for watermarking.  
I coded this in VSC and in PyCharm some packages will not work.
For this project I used PILLOW for opening and editing images and Tkinter for GUI.
